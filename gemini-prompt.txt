You are an expert software architect. Analyze the public Git repository at the following URL: ${repoUrl}. 
Based on its likely purpose and file structure, create a high-level architecture diagram in MermaidJS 'graph TD' format. 
The diagram should illustrate the main components and their interactions.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Your entire response must be ONLY the MermaidJS code, starting with 'graph TD'.
2. Do not include any explanations, markdown fences (```), or any other text.
3. If a node's text contains special characters like parentheses (), slashes /, or brackets [], you MUST enclose the entire text in double quotes. For example, use C["Description with (details/path)"] instead of C[Description with (details/path)].
4. Keep the diagram concise - use maximum 20 nodes and 50 edges (arrows/connections) to ensure clarity and readability.
